# Engram

> *engram (n.) — the physical trace a memory leaves in the brain.*

A personal memory OS: capture anything from your phone in under 10 seconds, have it
automatically organized, linked, and searchable by meaning — self-directed, hosted for
€0/month on the laptop you already own, with zero manual filing.

**Capture → Store → Organize → Link → Understand → Reason → Act**

## Status

📋 **Planning complete (v1.5) — build not started.**
The full audited build plan is in [plan.md](plan.md) (milestones M0–M7, architecture,
budget, risks, and the 12 spec flags that were found and fixed). v1.5 adds the
HuziOS/Engram convergence: laptop-first €0 hosting, HuziOS glass UI as the eventual
interface (M3.5), Obsidian vault indexed rather than migrated.

## Architecture at a glance

- **One box (yours):** the laptop — Docker Compose via WSL2 · Caddy · FastAPI · worker · Telegram bot poller. Phone reaches the dashboard over Tailscale; Tailscale Funnel exposes the two surfaces that need public HTTPS (email ingestion, claude.ai MCP connector). A Hetzner-VPS graduation runbook is documented from M0 — an afternoon move, made only when laptop uptime actually hurts
- **One database:** PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector (vectors, full-text search, graph tables, job queue)
- **Capture:** Telegram bot via long-polling (text, links, photos, files, voice — offline queueing free, no public IP needed) + dashboard quick-note as the direct private path; no app store, no native build
- **Interface:** HuziOS's glass UI, ported panel-by-panel onto Engram's API at M3.5 (strangler fig — HuziOS stays the untouched daily driver until then); the Obsidian vault stays source of truth for study content and is indexed **read-only** into the same search space
- **AI tiers:** Python heuristics (free) → cloud fast model (classify) → cloud smart model (enrich/briefing), hard daily budget cap
- **AI provider:** replaceable by design — any OpenAI-compatible API via `.env` config, restricted to providers that don't train on API traffic (start: OpenAI); swaps gated by a classification eval set
- **Mentor mode:** Engram exposes a remote MCP server; claude.ai (existing Pro sub) is the mentor interface — zero API cost for reasoning
- **Embeddings:** multilingual-e5-small (Malay + English), 384-dim, CPU
- **Running cost:** €0/mo hosting + one-time ~$10 API topup (~a year); domain ~$10/yr only at M5 (email); backups on Backblaze B2 free tier

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Delivers |
|---|---|
| M0 | Infra live on the laptop: Docker, Tailscale HTTPS, auth, B2 backups |
| M1 | Capture via Telegram bot (long-polling) from any device, <10s |
| M2 | Hybrid semantic + keyword search |
| M3 | Auto-classification (budget-capped) |
| M3.5 | HuziOS glass UI ported onto Engram + Obsidian vault indexed read-only |
| M4 | Entity graph, related captures, projects |
| M5 | Morning briefing, rediscovery, email ingestion |
| M6 | Deep enrichment, mentor via claude.ai MCP connector |
| M7 | Hardening, export, voice, optional native app |

MVP = M0–M3, ~1 month of build sessions.

## M0 — Run it

### Before you start (manual, one-time, outside this repo)
- Buy a domain (Cloudflare Registrar) and point its DNS A-record at your VPS.
- Create a Hetzner CX22 VPS (or equivalent) with Docker + Docker Compose installed.
- Turn on 2FA for your Cloudflare account.
- Create a Backblaze B2 bucket + application key (kept off Cloudflare on purpose — see plan.md).
- OpenAI API key: not needed yet, deferred to M3.
- Telegram bot token: not needed yet, deferred to M1.

### Configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in `.env`:
- `DOMAIN` / `ACME_EMAIL` — your domain and Let's Encrypt contact.
- `POSTGRES_*` / `DATABASE_URL` — pick a long random Postgres password.
- `AUTH_USERNAME` — your login username.
- `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` — generate with:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm python:3.12-slim sh -c "pip -q install bcrypt && python -c \"import bcrypt;print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'YOUR_PASSWORD',bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())\""
  ```
  Wrap the result in single quotes when you paste it into `.env` (`AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH='$2b$12$...'`) — otherwise Docker Compose's env_file interpolation and bash's `source` treat `$2b` etc. as variable references and silently blank them out.
- `JWT_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` / `RESTIC_PASSWORD` / `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` / `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY` — from your B2 bucket + key.

### Run
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
For local testing without a domain, set `DOMAIN=localhost` in `.env` — Caddy issues an internal cert — or hit the API directly at `http://localhost:8000`.

Check it's alive: `curl https://$DOMAIN/health` (or `curl localhost:8000/health` locally) → `{"status":"ok"}`.

Log in:
```bash
curl -X POST https://$DOMAIN/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"<AUTH_USERNAME>","password":"<your password>"}'
```
Use the returned `access_token` as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against `GET /api/v1/me`.

### Backups
Schedule nightly via host crontab (not a container — laziest option, no extra service):
```
0 3 * * *  cd /opt/engram && ./scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/engram-backup.log 2>&1
```
To drill the restore half of the exit test: run `./scripts/backup.sh`, then `./scripts/restore.sh` — it restores the latest snapshot into a scratch DB and prints the `users` row count so you can confirm the data survived.
