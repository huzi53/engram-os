# TODO

Running checklist for the Engram-OS + HuziOS repo work. Updated as steps complete.

## Done — 2026-07-21

- [x] Pulled `origin/main` (v1.4 → v1.5, "HuziOS/Engram convergence"); merged clean
      with local uncommitted M0 footnotes in `plan.md` (no conflict markers).
- [x] Found `huzi53/HuziOS` was **public** with the full Obsidian vault tracked in git
      (personal ACCA notes + copyrighted course PDFs/PPTs) — flagged to user.
- [x] Set `huzi53/HuziOS` to **private**.
- [x] Created `huzi53/huzios-public` — clean-history export of app code + docs only
      (`app/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `journey-into-HuziOS.md`, `start.cmd`, `start-hidden.vbs`).
      `vault/`, `backups/`, `.claude/`, `plans/` never entered its history.
- [x] Scanned both exports for hardcoded secrets/API keys/tracked `.env` — none found.
- [x] Added MIT `LICENSE` to `engram-os` and `huzios-public`.
- [x] Added GitHub topics to both public repos for discoverability.
- [x] Committed + pushed the v1.5 merge to `engram-os`.

## M0 laptop-first rework (decision made: proceeding, full pipeline)

- [x] Planner: wrote `plans/003-m0-laptop-first-rework.md`. Decision: HTTPS via
      `tailscale serve` (not Caddy internal CA — avoids phone cert warnings), Caddy
      stays as internal reverse proxy. `plans/002` marked superseded, not rewritten.
      Frontend: no. Security pass: not warranted this round (auth.py/JWT/backup creds
      unchanged; only change is network exposure shrinking VPS-public → tailnet-only).
- [x] Builder: executed `plans/003-m0-laptop-first-rework.md`, 8/8 steps, no deviations.
      Caddyfile → plain reverse proxy (Tailscale terminates TLS); .env.example dropped
      DOMAIN/ACME_EMAIL; compose Caddy port → 127.0.0.1:8080 only, dropped cert volumes;
      README "Run it" rewritten for WSL2/Tailscale/Task Scheduler; new
      `docs/vps-graduation.md` runbook; plans/002 marked superseded. Committed `86c2fbc`
      (not pushed). `pytest app/test_auth.py` → 6 passed. Docker/WSL2 not present in this
      environment — compose/Caddy/backup round-trip checks are static-only, not
      runtime-verified; real verification needs the actual laptop.
- [x] Simplifier: reviewed full commit `86c2fbc` diff — nothing to cut, no speculative
      abstractions/dead config found. `pytest` re-run (6 passed), compose/CI YAML
      re-validated with `yaml.safe_load`. 0 lines removed, shipped as-is.
- [x] Reviewer: verdict SHIP. 3 low-severity non-blocking findings, fixed directly
      (commit `b7c36ac`): auth.py 500-on-malformed-hash → 401; restore.sh missing
      `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` (silent partial restore); backup.sh leaking temp dirs.
      Verified: JWT logic sound (no alg confusion, correct type-gating, bcrypt
      constant-time), no leftover DOMAIN/ACME_EMAIL refs, init.sql/restore target
      a scratch DB not the live one. `pytest` 6 passed after fixes.
- [x] Security: skipped — planner's call confirmed by reviewer (auth.py logic
      unchanged in scope, only a failure-mode fix; network exposure strictly shrank).
- [x] Frontend: skipped — no UI in this pass.
- [x] Verifier: **PASS WITH GAPS**. Ran `pytest` (6 passed), validated compose/CI YAML,
      traced the Caddy port chain (`:80` → `127.0.0.1:8080` → `tailscale serve localhost:8080`,
      consistent), grepped repo clean of stray DOMAIN/ACME_EMAIL, proved the auth.py fix
      by reproducing `bcrypt.checkpw` raising `ValueError` on a malformed hash, `bash -n`
      on both scripts. Honest gaps (expected, sandbox has no Docker/WSL2/Tailscale/restic):
      live `docker compose up`, live `tailscale serve` + phone login, live backup→restore
      round-trip. **These three need to be run for real on the actual laptop before M0 is
      truly done** — see "Still needs the user's laptop" below.
- [x] Commits landed: `86c2fbc` (rework + first-time scaffold commit), `b7c36ac`
      (reviewer-fix follow-up). Not yet pushed to origin.

## Still needs the user's laptop (can't run in this sandbox)

- [x] Docker Desktop + WSL2 (Ubuntu) + Tailscale — all confirmed installed and running
      (Docker Desktop just needed launching + login; CLI at
      `C:\Users\xyqie\AppData\Local\Programs\DockerDesktop\resources\bin\docker.exe`).
- [x] `.env` created from `.env.example`. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`DATABASE_URL` and
      `JWT_SECRET` auto-generated (random, low-sensitivity). `RESTIC_*`/`B2_*` left as
      placeholders — user doesn't have a Backblaze B2 account yet, deferred as its own
      step (doesn't block compose/login).
- [x] User generated `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` themselves (password never entered this
      chat), wired into `.env`.
- [x] `docker compose up -d` → db healthy, api + caddy started.
      `curl localhost:8080/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.
- [x] Login confirmed working locally with real credentials → returned `access_token`.
- [x] `tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:8080` enabled (had to approve Serve for
      the tailnet at the one-time admin-console link — account action, user did this).
      Live at `https://bubu-ayien.tail8ab968.ts.net/`.
- [x] **M0 exit test half 1: PASSED.** Phone reached `https://bubu-ayien.tail8ab968.ts.net/health`
      → `{"status":"ok"}` over mobile data (Wi-Fi off), once the phone's Tailscale app
      was connected (it had been idle/offline — reconnecting it was the fix).
- [x] Backblaze B2 bucket (`EngramOS-Backup`, US West) + scoped app key created by
      user, wired into `.env`. `restic init` run against `b2:EngramOS-Backup:engram`.
- [x] **M0 exit test half 2: PASSED.** `./scripts/backup.sh` → `./scripts/restore.sh`
      round trip against the real B2 repo: `users` row count = 1, matches expected.
      Along the way: installed `restic` + enabled Docker Desktop's WSL integration for
      Ubuntu (both one-time host setup, not repo changes) — Docker Desktop restart from
      that toggle stopped all containers, brought them back with `docker compose up -d`.
      Found and fixed a real regression: the earlier "leaked temp dir" fix in
      `backup.sh` (commit `b7c36ac`) had switched to a plain `mktemp` file, which broke
      `restore.sh`'s hardcoded `engram-db.dump` filename lookup — restore silently found
      nothing. Fixed in `45cd2db`: back to `mktemp -d` + fixed filename, cleaned up with
      `rm -rf` on the directory (the reviewer's originally-suggested alternative)
      instead of `rm -f` on the file. Caught only because the full round trip was
      actually run end to end, not just statically reviewed.
- [x] **M0 fully done — both exit-test halves pass on the real laptop.**
- [x] Pushed `main` to origin (all commits through `45cd2db`).

## Optional follow-up (not required for M0, noted for later)

- [ ] Set up the actual Windows Task Scheduler nightly job for `backup.sh` (README's
      "Backups" section has the exact steps) — verified manually today, but not yet
      running on an automated schedule.
- [x] Committed `plans/001-huzios-port-vs-fresh-build.md` — had been sitting untracked
      since the original planning session, caught during a git-status sweep.

## M1 — Capture works (full pipeline)

- [x] Planner: wrote `plans/004-m1-capture.md`. Scope: `POST /api/v1/capture`
      (text/URL/photo/file/audio), Telegram long-polling bot, dashboard quick-note box
      (first UI in the repo), captures list (newest-first), blake2b exact dedup.
      Frontend: **yes**. Security pass: **warranted** — new Telegram ingestion path +
      user file uploads are real trust boundaries (unlike the M0 rework).
- [ ] Builder: execute `plans/004-m1-capture.md`.
- [ ] Simplifier: cut over-engineering from the diff.
- [ ] Reviewer: correctness pass.
- [ ] Security: scoped review — Telegram allowlist gate, file-upload path traversal,
      disk-fill caps, token-in-localStorage.
- [ ] Frontend: polish + browser-check the quick-note box and captures list.
- [ ] Verifier: final gate, exit-test evidence.
