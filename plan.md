## Locked decisions (from planning session, 2026-07-20)

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Audience | Single user (Huzi). No multi-tenancy, no third-party auth service. Keep `user_id` column for future-proofing only. |
| Access | Hosted on a cheap VPS, reachable from anywhere over HTTPS. Not localhost. Laptop stays available as a fallback/worker but is not the primary host. |
| Phone | Android. Capture via installable PWA with Web Share Target (day one), optional tiny native app later. |
| AI tiers | **No local LLM** (no GPU). Tier 1 = Python heuristics (free). Tier 2 = Claude Haiku (classification). Tier 3 = Claude Sonnet (enrichment, briefing, mentor). Hard daily budget cap. |
| Budget | ~$10–20/month total: VPS ~€5–9 + Claude API ~$5–10. |
| Build mode | Claude Code writes the code; Huzi directs, reviews, and tests. Pace is set by review bandwidth, not coding time. |
| Priorities | 1) Capture + search. 2) Auto-organization + linking. Briefing/rediscovery next; mentor/insights later. |

## Goal

A personal memory system: capture anything from the phone in under 10 seconds, have it
automatically organized, linked, and searchable by meaning — accessible from anywhere,
running for under $20/month, with zero manual filing.

## Architecture (right-sized)

One box, one database, one app:

```
Android phone ──share──> PWA (Next.js, installed)         Laptop/desktop ──> same PWA
                              │ HTTPS
                              v
                    VPS (Hetzner, Docker Compose)
                    ├─ Caddy          (HTTPS, reverse proxy)
                    ├─ FastAPI        (API + auth: single-user JWT)
                    ├─ Worker         (pipeline: extract → classify → embed → link)
                    ├─ PostgreSQL 16  (+ pgvector) — captures, entities, relations,
                    │                   full-text search, vector search, job queue
                    └─ /data volume   (raw files) + nightly restic backup → Cloudflare R2/B2
                              │
                              v
                    Claude API (Haiku = cheap classify, Sonnet = deep work)
                    CPU embeddings on VPS (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim)
```

**What replaced the spec's 6 datastores:** Postgres does vectors (pgvector), full-text
search (tsvector), graph (`entities` + `capture_relations` tables + recursive CTEs),
metadata (JSONB), and the job queue (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`). Files live on the VPS
disk. Neo4j, Qdrant, Meilisearch, MinIO, Redis, Celery: all deferred until data volume
proves the need (likely never for one user).

## Milestones

Each milestone is a checkpoint with a testable exit criterion. Build order = priority order.

### M0 — Infrastructure live
Domain + Hetzner VPS + Docker Compose (Caddy, FastAPI hello-world, Postgres+pgvector)
+ HTTPS + single-user JWT login + nightly encrypted backup job.
**Exit test:** you log in from your phone over the internet; a restore from backup works.

### M1 — Capture works (MVP core)
`POST /api/v1/capture` (text, URL, photo, file) · PWA with Web Share Target registered
on Android · quick-note box · client retry queue (IndexedDB) so capture never fails ·
blake2b exact-hash dedup · captures list view (newest first).
**Exit test:** share a TikTok link, a photo, and a text note from your phone in <10s each;
all three appear in the dashboard; sharing the same link twice creates one capture.

### M2 — Search works
Tier-1 extraction (URL scrape/metadata, dates via dateparser, amounts, emails, phones;
Tesseract OCR for images) · CPU embeddings (MiniLM, 384-dim) on every capture ·
hybrid search endpoint (pgvector cosine + Postgres FTS, merged) · search UI.
**Exit test:** capture 50+ real items, then find a specific one by meaning ("that article
about sleep") and by keyword, in the top 3 results.

### M3 — Auto-organization (priority feature)
Haiku classification per capture (categories, tags, title, priority, content_type,
deadline, action_required — the spec's Stage-2 prompt, pointed at Haiku) ·
AI Router with daily budget cap + spend tracking table · category/tag browse UI ·
thumbs up/down feedback stored on captures.
**Exit test:** a week of real captures lands >80% correctly categorized with sensible
titles, at <$0.15/day API spend.

### M4 — Linking & graph
`entities` + `capture_entities` + `capture_relations` tables (spec schema, corrected SQL) ·
entity extraction (from Haiku output + heuristics) · similarity links (cosine > 0.82) ·
temporal-proximity + shared-entity + project links · projects CRUD · "Related" panel
on every capture.
**Exit test:** open any capture and see genuinely related items; open a project and see
everything that belongs to it without ever having filed anything.

### M5 — Daily loop: briefing + rediscovery
Morning briefing (cron 06:55: pending tasks, due dates, yesterday's captures, 1–3
rediscovered items → one Sonnet call → dashboard card + optional push via ntfy) ·
rediscovery scoring (spec §8, simplified: project-context + semantic + anniversary) ·
email ingestion via IMAP **polling** (dedicated Gmail address, checked every 5 min).
**Exit test:** for one week, the morning card is worth reading, and a forwarded email
becomes a searchable capture.

### M6 — Deep enrichment + mentor v1
Selective Sonnet enrichment (spec §4.4 trigger rules: high priority / long content /
finance / low confidence) · mentor chat endpoint grounded in vector search over your
own captures · insights v1 (capture-habit patterns only).
**Exit test:** ask the mentor a question about something you captured a month ago and
get an answer citing the right captures.

### M7 — Hardening
Voice notes (faster-whisper tiny, CPU) if wanted · security pass (rate limit, input
validation, file-type checks, headers) · restore drill + data export (JSON + files) ·
performance pass · optional: tiny native Android app (share intent + widget) if the
PWA share target ever feels limiting.
**Exit test:** full export restores on a clean machine; dashboard loads <2s on phone.

## Dependencies

**Before M0 (decisions/purchases — the only things Claude Code can't do for you):**
- [ ] Hetzner account + VPS (CX22 ~€4.50/mo to start; resize to 8GB later if OCR/whisper need it)
- [ ] A domain name (~$10/yr) pointed at the VPS
- [ ] Anthropic API key with a low spend limit set in console
- [ ] Cloudflare R2 or Backblaze B2 bucket for backups (free tiers cover this)
- [ ] A dedicated Gmail address for email-forward capture (needed by M5, cheap to create now)

**Internal blockers:**
- M1 blocks everything (no data → nothing downstream matters)
- M3's AI Router (budget cap) must exist before M6 (Sonnet enrichment) to prevent cost surprises
- Embedding model choice is **locked at M2** (384-dim MiniLM) — changing later means re-embedding everything (cheap at personal scale, but a migration)

## Estimated time

Build mode is "Claude Code writes it, Huzi reviews" — so estimates are in
review-sessions, not coding-hours. Assume 2–4 sessions/week. **Low confidence overall**
(solo, first project of this shape); M0–M2 estimates are firmer than M5–M7.

| Milestone | Sessions | Calendar (rough) |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Infra | 2–3 | Week 1 |
| M1 Capture | 3–4 | Weeks 1–2 |
| M2 Search | 3–4 | Weeks 2–3 |
| M3 Auto-org | 3–4 | Weeks 3–4 |
| M4 Linking | 4–5 | Weeks 5–6 |
| M5 Briefing/rediscovery | 4–5 | Weeks 7–8 |
| M6 Enrichment/mentor | 4–6 | Weeks 9–11 |
| M7 Hardening | 3–4 | Week 12+ |

MVP you'd actually use daily = **M0–M3, roughly a month**. Everything after runs on real
accumulated data, which is exactly what M4–M6 need to be tuneable.

## Risks

| Risk | Why it's real here | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Abandonment mid-build** (the spec itself jokes about a 50% abandonment pattern) | 24-week horizon, solo | Plan is cut so M1–M3 (~1 month) already delivers daily value; every milestone is independently useful |
| **Capture friction kills adoption** | If sharing takes >10s or fails offline, you stop using it and the data moat never forms | PWA share target + IndexedDB retry queue in M1, before any AI work |
| **API cost creep** | No local tier to absorb load; every smart feature is metered | Budget-cap table + router before Sonnet features; Anthropic console spend limit as backstop |
| **Small-VPS resource limits** | OCR + embeddings + Postgres on 4GB RAM | Tesseract (light) not PaddleOCR; batch embedding; resize VPS is a 2-minute operation |
| **Classification quality disappoints** ("zero manual organization" is the promise) | Haiku on terse captures can misfile | Feedback buttons from M3 day one; misfiles feed prompt tuning; escalate low-confidence to Sonnet within budget |
| **Data loss** (spec anti-pattern #10: "this is someone's life") | Single VPS is a single point of failure | Encrypted nightly offsite backups from M0, restore actually tested in M0 and re-drilled in M7 |
| **PWA share-target limitations** | Some apps share weird payloads; PWA can't do accessibility/screenshot monitoring | Accept for MVP; native Android app is a contained M7 add-on, not a rewrite |

## MVP

**M0–M3:** capture anything from the phone from anywhere, exact-dedup, hybrid
semantic+keyword search, auto-classification with budget-capped Haiku, browsable by
category/tag. One VPS, one database, one PWA. This tests the core assumption —
*"if capture is frictionless and retrieval is smart, I'll actually use it"* — for
~€5 + pocket change in API calls per month.

## V2

**M4–M6:** entity/relation graph in Postgres, related-capture surfacing, projects,
morning briefing, rediscovery, email ingestion, selective deep enrichment, mentor chat
over your own data, first insights.

## V3 (rough)

Voice capture, native Android app + home-screen widget, browser extension,
spaced-repetition study system + quiz generation (spec §9), finance pattern tracking,
reflection engine (spec §11), notification intelligence, third-party API/webhooks —
and only if data volume ever demands it: dedicated vector/graph/search stores.

## Appendix A: Spec deviations & fixes

Flags found in the source spec and how this plan resolves them:

1. **Embedding dimension mismatch** — spec schema says `Vector(1536)` but its own stack
   picks `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim). **Fix:** 384-dim everywhere; pgvector column
   `vector(384)`. Migration path documented if we ever switch models.
2. **Qdrant AND pgvector both specced** — **Fix:** pgvector only.
3. **Invalid SQL** — double-quoted string literals (`DEFAULT "{}"`, `IN ("HIGH",...)`)
   and malformed GIN index syntax. **Fix:** rewrite schema with single quotes, correct
   `USING GIN (column)` syntax, during M1.
4. **Duplicate graph layers** (Neo4j + Postgres relation tables). **Fix:** Postgres
   tables are the single source of truth; Neo4j dropped.
5. **"IMAP webhook"** doesn't exist. **Fix:** IMAP polling every 5 min (latency target
   relaxed from <30s to <5min — irrelevant for personal email capture).
6. **Stale model names** (`claude-sonnet-4`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-1.5-pro`). **Fix:** current
   Claude models via one config constant: Haiku for classify, Sonnet for enrich/mentor.
7. **Local LLM tier assumed GPU** — user has none. **Fix:** tier 2 becomes Claude Haiku;
   heuristics tier absorbs everything it can for free; hard daily budget cap enforced
   in the router (spec's throttling ladder kept: 80% → downgrade, 100% → heuristics only).
8. **Six datastores for one user** contradicts the spec's own anti-pattern #9
   ("don't over-engineer v1"). **Fix:** Postgres + disk + Caddy; queue via
   `SKIP LOCKED`; Redis/Celery/Meilisearch/MinIO deferred behind real need.
9. **Multi-user auth (Supabase/Clerk)** for a single-user system. **Fix:** single-user
   JWT (one password + long-lived refresh), `user_id` kept in schema for optionality.
10. **iOS/Android native app in Phase 1** — **Fix:** Android PWA Web Share Target at M1
    (works day one, no store, no Mac); native app demoted to optional M7.
11. **Screenshot accessibility-service monitoring** — Play-policy minefield and not
    needed for a personal sideload; **deferred to V3**, share-sheet covers screenshots fine.
12. **24-week team-sized roadmap** — **Fix:** re-phased to milestone/review-session
    model above; MVP value lands at ~1 month instead of week 4 of 24.

## Appendix B: Next step

Per the planning skill: this plan defines *what* and *in which order*. The first build
session (M0) should start by running the **system-architect** pass to fix the concrete
repo layout, docker-compose file, corrected Postgres schema DDL, and API surface — then
scaffold it. Say **"start M0"** in a new session in this folder to kick off.
